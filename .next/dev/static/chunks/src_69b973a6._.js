            <p>When I decided to pursue a B.Tech in Computer Science, I had a vision of where I wanted to be—a tech enthusiast eager to decode the mysteries of algorithms, software, and innovation. Little did I know, this journey would be far more than just academic—it would be a holistic development of skills, resilience, and perspective.</p>
            <h3>Starting with Curiosity</h3>
            <p>The first year of B.Tech felt like diving into an ocean of opportunities and challenges. Subjects like programming, discrete mathematics, and digital logic introduced me to the fundamentals. As exciting as it was, the real challenge lay in adapting to the fast-paced environment.</p>
            <h3>Learning Beyond the Classroom</h3>
            <p>One of the most exciting aspects of a B.Tech journey is the exposure to real-world applications. Internships, hackathons, and group projects bring a flavor of the industry right to the college campus. My participation in a web development internship not only improved my coding skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration and meeting deadlines.</p>
            <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
            <p>As a student specializing in Blockchain and Cybersecurity, I know the journey is far from over. The upcoming semesters will bring more specialized subjects, exciting projects, and opportunities to explore areas like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.</p>
